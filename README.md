# PyCitySchools_Challenge

The school district has a record of all the high schools in the area.  The schools have all kept track of test scores for both reading and mathematics.  The school is trying to see which schools need funding, and which schools are doing well with their respective programs.  

    The district schools receive more funding than the charter schools, and the average test scores are lower as a whole.  

    A lot of the schools I have noticed have high reading scores, but the math scores are often lower, causing the passing rates in some schools in the district to underperform       compared to the schools in the charter schools.

    Replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores ended up making the average a little bit higher for Thomas High School, making it the second highest performing school in     the district.

    By replacing the ninth grader scores in a lot of schools will make the scores look better.  A lot of the students in higher grades on average had better scores than the the       ninth graders.  It will also change the cost per student as well, since we take out one fourth of the data, it causes the cost to go up.

One big change is that Thomas High School went higher on the list of averages.  Another change is that the cost per student also increased as well.  The student roster was also decreased by 25%, and the budget became larger.
